### Application of Machine Learning and geospatial techniques for individual Acacia tree species mapping
#### The project aims to develop a novel approach of automating the detection of Acacia species from very high resolution satellite imagery. The system would then do image segmentation to identify individual Acacia tree crowns. A correlation betweek crown area and volume was then applied to infer volume of Acacia over a large area. The script is written in pure R using geospatial libraries to automate the task.

#### Detailed documentation will be provided soon. This is a work in progress
